#IEEE Linux Workshop

We are creating and running a linux tutorial workshop for IEEE members who want to learn how to use and gain experience using linux. We are hoping that this will allow kids to start gaining the experience they will need to be successful in the workplace.

Checkout the LessonPlans.md to check out what we have planned so far, and if you have anything you want to add or change send me a pull request!

Thank you!
